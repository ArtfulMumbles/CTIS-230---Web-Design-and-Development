    <h1><u>Hamlet Character Analysis</u></h1>
    <h2>Why did Ophelia stay with Hamlet throughout the whole play despite his craziness?</h2>

      William Shakespeare’s <em>Hamlet</em> draws attention to the thin veil that often separates appearance and reality.
      The ups and downs of the tremulous relationship between Ophelia and Hamlet and the controlling relationship between Ophelia and her imperious
      family illustrates that things are not always what they seem.    While Hamlet is at times verbally abusive and oblivious to Ophelia, he also sometimes serves
      as a release from the domineering and patronizing attitude of her father and brother.    The loss of this outlet as Hamlet progressively becomes more consumed
      with avenging his father is one of the primary causes of Ophelia’s untimely death.

    <p class="essay">
      From the very beginning of the play, the most important people in Ophelia’s life have been at odds, and the “<em>many tenders of… affection</em>” Hamlet extends to
      Ophelia beget a negative response from her father and brother.    They portend that Hamlet is only transiently in love with her and remind Ophelia that he is
      “<em>subject to his birth</em>” and as such may not be able to marry her.    While in good faith, the efforts of her family to separate her from a relationship that might
      ultimately harm her are thinly veiled attempts to maintain control over Ophelia’s life.    It is implied that Laertes and Polonious know better than Ophelia regarding
      Hamlet and that she must listen to avoid dishonoring their reputation in court.    These motives are entirely selfish and though in the end Ophelia claims that she
      “<em>will obey,</em>” her reluctance to accept the rhetoric of her father and brother indicates she does so begrudgingly.    Ophelia at this point seems trapped by the wishes
      of her father and brother, confined by their wishes, and prohibited from exploring her own.

      Ophelia indicates that her interactions with Hamlet are different than those with her family.    Hamlet has “<em>importuned her with love</em>” and talks to her in a
      loving manner.    He also views her as important and, instead of getting her to make promises to him, makes “<em>holy vows</em>” to her.    Whereas Polonius and Laertes
      want only to take from her, Hamlet seems to only want to give.    Hamlet is to Ophelia a chance to be heard and valued for her own ideas and self rather
      than for the self that her family wants her to be.    The promises that Hamlet makes to her builds a trust within her drives he resentment at heeding her
      family’s advice.    It is no wonder then, that after Hamlet decides to “<em>put on an antic disposition</em>”  on without telling her, she begins to break.    He begins
      to insult her and treat her hostile, suggesting that she be “<em>sent to a nunnery.   </em>” As Hamlet makes these remarks descending further into insanity, Ophelia beings
      to lose an outlet that she relied upon.

    <p class="essay">
      The loss of Hamlet as a confident is likely what put Ophelia in a desperate enough position that she thought to end her life.    While towards the beginning of
      the play, Ophelia thought of Hamlet as an equal and a lover who cared for her as she cared for him, his actions towards the end of the play cause her to question
      whether anyone could feel that way about her.    These thoughts are evident when Ophelia begins to sing in front of Claudius’ court.    In her song, she questions
      how one can know a “<em>true love… from another,</em>” indicating that she doubts that Hamlet ever loved her in the first place.    After seemingly being accepted as a
      person rather than a tool, Ophelia’s hopes are crushed resulting in her death.
