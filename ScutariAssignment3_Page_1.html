    <p id="introduction">
      This website was created by Michael Alexander Scutari for <strong>CTIS-230: Web Design and Development</strong> at Guilford College.
      As you look through these pages, keep in mind that this website is not designed to be a masterwork, but rather to demonstrate the simple
      yet effective tools for web development that are taught over the course of the three week class. This paragraph in particular is meant to
      demonstrate floating an image. As you can see, the Guilford College logo on the left hand side of the screen is being wrapped by this text.
      This means that both can be displayed side by side. In addition, on mobile devices this allows the image to be displayed without having
      to do any crazy scrolling. The trick here will be to size this text perfectly so that it goes no further than the bottom of this image.
