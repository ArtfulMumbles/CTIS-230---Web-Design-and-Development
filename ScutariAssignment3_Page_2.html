    <h1>My Thoughts on TFT Set 5</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2><u>Initial Release:</u></h2>
    <p>
      Though the new Set for Teamfight Tactics has not yet been released on public servers, it is currently available through the <strong>PBE</strong>.
      The launch can so far be described as smooth, and there have been no large bugs as of yet. At the time, it is unclear when a live server release
      can be expected, however estimates put it to be within the next week.
    </p>

    <h2><u>Changes from Set 4:</u></h2>
    <p>
      There have been several important changes between this set and the last. For starters, the <strong>chosen mechanic</strong> will <strong>not</strong> be returning this set.
      From my perspective, this is a welcomed change. Chosen in the previous set were unweidly and often times unnessessary. Carry champs of the last set, more below,
      could do fine without a chosen. In addition, max rank perks that required a chosen often also required a spatula to complete, making the aspect of randomly
      getting a chosen completely irrelevant. Even if a spatula was not required, it was not particularly hard to force a particular chosen by rerolling or simply by
      being patient.
    </p>
    <h3>New Traits:</h3>
    <p>This time around, there are two different types of traits and champions will have both an <strong>origin</strong> and a <strong>class.</strong></p>

    <div class="flexible">
      <div class="content">
        <h4>Classes:</h4>
        <ul class=default>
          <li>Abomination</li>

          <li>Eternal</li>
          <li>Forgotten</li>

          <li>Revenant</li>

        </ul>
      </div>

    <p>
      As shown above, there are lots of new options as well as fan favorites. <strong>Assassins</strong>, which has been present in nearly every set, will be making a comeback
      and will have the same effect as in the previous set. In addition, <strong>Rangers</strong>, seen last in Set 2, will also be returning. New traits include <strong>Ironclad</strong>
      and <strong>Cavalier</strong>. For more, reference the image below:

    <h2><u>What I am Looking for From Set 5:</u></h2>
    <p>
      Last set was a complete disappointment in my mind. While there were new features, the game could not have become more bland. The presence of <em>super carry champs</em>
      like Kayle and Aurelion Sol meant that certain comps could never be viable. Set 4 was not about making a <em>team</em> of champions, but rather about buffing <em>one
      specific champion</em> that had the ability to carry. While this has been relatively for all other sets, it was especially prevalent last Set. From Set 5, I am hoping that
      we there will be new avenues to victory that involve carefully manipulating your economy and your shop, and that the reliably forcing the same comp every game will no longer
      be an option.
